# TBH 
I just wanted to meddle with AI to see what it can do.
I've done most the the application infastructure, debug, and DI.
But the rest of the code is generated by AI.
Here's the rest.


# Seed

## Overview
The Seed Project is a .NET 8-based application designed to manage folder structures and file operations.
It provides functionality to parse folder structures from files, write folder structures to disk, and perform various file-related operations.
The project is modular, with distinct layers for domain logic, infrastructure, and application services.

## Features
- **Folder Parsing**: Convert structured text files into folder models.
- **Folder Writing**: Create folder structures on disk based on parsed models.
- **File Reading**: Read file contents with robust error handling.
- **Unit Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage using xUnit.

## Technologies Used
- **.NET 8**: Latest framework for modern application development.
- **Spectre.Console**: For building rich terminal interfaces.
- **Dependency Injection**: Managed via `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`.
- **xUnit**: Unit testing framework.
- **Docker Support**: Configured for Linux-based containers.

## Project Structure
- **Seed.Application**: Contains application-level contracts and models.
- **Seed.Cross**: Shared utilities and cross-cutting concerns.
- **Seed.Domain**: Core business logic and service implementations.
- **Seed.Infrastructure**: Infrastructure-level implementations for file and folder operations.
- **Seed.Terminal**: Entry point for the application, providing a terminal interface.
- **Seed.Domain.UnitTest**: Unit tests for domain logic.
- **Seed.Domain.InfrastructureTests**: Unit tests for infrastructure components.
